Application build following howtographql.com's GraphQL + Node back-end tutorial.

## How To Build and Run

Aside from the normal `yarn install` / `npm install`, you'll need to set-up the
Prisma API. Now, because I don't yet know what the best practices are for hiding
or obscuring Prisma API endpoints is, I just .gitignored all Prisma related
files that contained the plaintext endpoint. You'll, therefore, need to set up
your own Prisma server and database which you can do so via the same
howtographql.com instructions that I used.

First, you'll need to create your `prisma.yml` file in your prisma/ directory:

```bash
touch ./prisma/prisma.yml
```

Then, add the following contents to your `prisma.yml` file:

```yml
# The HTTP endpoint for your Prisma API
endpoint: ''

# Points to the file that contains your datamodel
datamodel: datamodel.prisma

# Specifies language & location for the generated Prisma client
generate:
  - generator: javascript-client
    output: ../src/generated/prisma-client
```

If the Prisma CLI is not already installed, install it via

```bash
yarn global add prisma
```

or

```bash
npm install prisma -g
```

Now run `prisma deploy` and follow the prompts to deploy your Prisma server. I
used the demo database. Here are the instructions to do the same from
howtographql.com's tutorial:

```text
The prisma deploy command starts an interactive process:

First select the Demo server. When the browser opens, register with Prisma Cloud and go back to your terminal.

Then you need to select the region for your Demo server. Once that’s done, you can just hit enter twice to use the suggested values for service and stage.

Note: Prisma is open-source. You can deploy it with Docker to a cloud provider of your choice (such as Digital Ocean, AWS, Google Cloud, …).

Once the command has finished running, the CLI writes the endpoint for the Prisma API to your prisma.yml. It will look similar to this: https://eu1.prisma.sh/john-doe/hackernews-node/dev.
```

Now run `prisma generate` and you're cooking with grease.
